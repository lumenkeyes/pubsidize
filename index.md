Pubsidize is a creator support platform with a 0% cut - we're supported entirely by donations made explicitly to us, not by skimming from money meant for someone else.

We're financially transparent, and only ask for as much as we need to keep the lights on - with 0 current users that's $5 CAD/mo.
