Pubsidize is a creator support platform with a 0% cut—we're supported entirely by donations made explicitly to us, not by skimming from money meant for someone else.

We're financially transparent, and only ask for as much as we need to keep the lights on—with `0` current users that's `$5 CAD/mo` to run the whole shebang.

Another neat thing is we're not a ploy to amass users and sell to a big company.

If you need there to be a catch it's that I'm absolute ass with some of the code libraries I'm using for this project.
